# Installation

## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.x found by /usr/bin/env
* Mac or Linux (sorry, Windows...)


## Installation on a Mac
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/frellus/md.git
```
2. Edit the `md` script to change any of the defaults as needed (ususally it's
   fine as is)

3. Copy the script to a command path (ex. `/usr/local/bin`)

4. Copy the templates to your documentation root folder. For example, if you
   were creating files under ~/workspace/software/docs then copy the following
   files there. Or not, they're not strictly required:
- `README-header.md`
- `README-footer.md`
- `TEMPLATE.md`

The default names of these files can be directly edited in the `md` script if
you do not like the name of the templates or you want to change the name of the
index file form `README.md` to something else.

5. Use and enjoy!
