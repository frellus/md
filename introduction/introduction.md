# Introduction
> Overview

TIL is intended to encourage someone to write a lot of documentation, especially
into smaller files which aren't worthy of a blog posting. This could be for
several different use cases such as:
- TIL (today I learned) collection
- FAQ
- Operational Runbooks
- embeded documentation tree in a software project

Writing things down re-enforces learning, sharing and organized thought, which
is the goal of this tool.
