## Inspiration
The inspiration for this was from an item on [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com):

* [I've been writing TILs for 5 years ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22908044)

The author, [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud) mentioned they've
been keeping a github repo of "Thigs I Learned" (TIL) and it was filled with
many good "gist" sized Markdown documents organized in a friendly way. See here:

[https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/)

What was missing from the repository was any indication on how he automated the
document collection or created new TIL files, so I decided to create a script
which would do something similiar after realizing this would encourage people to
create more documents, different types, and link them together in a single index

The author also mentions the idea about collecting person TIL was shamelessly
stolen from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
